# Configuration

## Local Settings

The Hyperchalk server is a Django project. So if you are famililar with configuring Django
applications, just head for the demo config and you are ready to go. If you are not famililar
with Django however, it should still be pretty easy for you to configure Hyperchalk. Our example
config provides you with comments that explain what each of the most important settings that you
can / should adept to you needs does. You can find the example config in the Hyperchalk repo as
`local_settings.example.py`. Most of the settings are furtherly explained in the
[Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/settings/). You should also have a look
at the [Django deployment checklist](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/howto/deployment/checklist/).
