In e-learning, collaborative online whiteboards have become a popular choice for implementing
collaborative learning. However, existing solutions fail to deliver data in a way that allows
for the application of learning analytics in this field. While the market offers several solutions,
most of them cannot be integrated with existing learning management systems and do not provide data
that can be used for learning analytics. To overcome this, we implement a digital collaborative
whiteboard based on the open source [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) and a
custom back-end. The whiteboard can be self-hosted, it collects rich log data appropriate for
learning analytics purposes and it integrates with learning management systems – such as Moodle –
using the LTI 1.3 Advantage standard.

🏆 Hyperchalk is award-winning software: We won the best demo award on the European Conference
